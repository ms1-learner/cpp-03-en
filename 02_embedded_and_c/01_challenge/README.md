# Challenge 1

There are several popular libraries aimed at providing utilities and containers for embedded C++ programs. These libraries may offer alternatives to standard template library containers such as `std::vector` that are safer to use in an embedded context, usually due to their avoidance of dynamic memory allocation, memory allocators and memory pools that make use of static memory and again avoid dynamic memory allocation, etc. Do some research and provide links to a couple of libraries that appear useful.
