# Challenge 1

Create a `Timer` class that measures the time elapsed between its construction and destruction. Use the RAII idiom to start the timer when the object is created and stop the timer when the object is destroyed. The class should print the elapsed time in milliseconds when the object is destroyed.

Begin with the following code as a starting point:

```cpp
#include <chrono>

class Timer {
public:
    // TODO
private:
    // TODO
};

int main() {
    Timer timer;
    // TODO
}
```
